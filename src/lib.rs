/// The `EventChannel`, which is the central component of `shrev`.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// This channel has a ring buffer, which it allocates with an initial capacity.
/// Once allocated, it writes new events into the buffer, wrapping around when
/// it reaches the "end" of the buffer.
///
/// However, before an event gets written into the buffer, the channel checks if
/// all readers have read the event which is about to be overwritten. In case
/// the answer is "No", it will grow the buffer so no events get overwritten.
///
/// Readers are stores in the `EventChannel` itself, because we need to access
/// their position in a write, so we can check what's described above. Thus, you
/// only get a `ReaderId` as a handle.
///
/// ## What do I use it for?
///
/// The `EventChannel` is basically a single producer, multiple consumer
/// ("SPMC") channel. That is, a `write` to the channel requires mutable access,
/// while reading can be done with just an immutable reference. All readers
/// (consumers) will always get all the events since their last read (or when
/// they were created, if there was no read yet).
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::drop;
///
/// use shrev::{EventChannel, ReaderId};
///
/// // The buffer will initially be 16 events big
/// let mut channel = EventChannel::with_capacity(16);
///
/// // This is basically with no effect; no reader can possibly observe it
/// channel.single_write(42i32);
///
/// let mut first_reader = channel.register_reader();
///
/// // What's interesting here is that we don't check the readers' positions _yet_
/// // That is because the size of 16 allows us to write 16 events before we need to perform
/// // such a check.
/// channel.iter_write(0..4);
///
/// // Now, we read 4 events (0, 1, 2, 3)
/// // Notice how we borrow the ID mutably; this is because logically we modify the reader,
/// // and we shall not read with the same ID concurrently
/// let _events = channel.read(&mut first_reader);
///
/// // Let's create a second reader; this one will not receive any of the previous events
/// let mut second_reader = channel.register_reader();
///
/// // No event returned
/// let _events = channel.read(&mut second_reader);
///
/// channel.iter_write(4..6);
///
/// // Both now get the same two events
/// let _events = channel.read(&mut first_reader);
/// let _events = channel.read(&mut second_reader);
///
/// // We no longer need our second reader, so we drop it
/// // This is important, since otherwise the buffer would keep growing if our reader doesn't read
/// // any events
/// drop(second_reader);
/// ```
